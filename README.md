# Chess Clock
This app is a switching timer that can be used by Chess players to time their game. This is different from any regular timer because when one player pauses his/her timer after playing their move, the opponent's timer is resumed immediately for their move.

The app's designing and coding gave me invaluable app design skills. It was also only my second app designed in Swift and proved a great learning opportunity for me.
